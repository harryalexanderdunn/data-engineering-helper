# Data Engineering Articles

I have written a few articles on some of the topics I have been working on. In general I find it a great way to share the knowledge I have gained and also expand on what I have learnt. If I am writing about the topic I really need to fully understand the topic to ensure what I am writing is correct.

## **Why should we be doing this?**

### Build Your Portfolio & the Team's Portfolio

One key thing about writing technical posts is that it can help build your portfolio as a developer. And it gives you an ample opportunity to be seen as skilled at what you do. Going forward we will start to showcase this to the wider team and demonstrate all the innovative work we do.

### Help Others

Before you got to the stage you are right now, some people helped you get there through videos and articles. That is enough reason to write contents for other people to learn from.

### Learn More

The more you write on a particular thing, or let me say the more you teach a particular thing, the better you get at it. Writing technical contents may involve you writing about an application you just built that gave you a lot of stress that you donâ€™t want other developers to go through. Or you just learned a new thing and you want the world to know what you have learned.

Doing the above mentioned, helps you build confidence in what you know.
