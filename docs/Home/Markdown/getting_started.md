# Getting Started

## Setup

So you have read the intro and agree that documentation as code is the way forward and that writing in markdown will help us get there. Now you want to start using markdown to write your documentation as code. So what is needed to get started? Our current Tech Stack includes VS Code & GitLab, both of these allow for viewing and editing markdown files. But, there are other programs you can use as well.

!!! warning

    Ensure that if you use a program to view/edit markdown files that it is either licensed or runs locally, we cannot store JLR information online without a license.

* VS Code (+ recommended extensions)
  * Markdown All in One
  * markdownlint
  * Markdown Extended
  * Markdown Preview Mermaid Support
  * Doc Writer Profile Template (all-in-one)
  * Code Spell Checker
* Obsidian
* logseq
* MarkText
* ghostwriter

You can use WSL or Windows to write and edit your code. Ensure that if you are using WSL & VSCode that you install the extensions within WSL VS code.

## Writing your docs

Once you have a programme setup to edit and view your markdown files in you can start to write your documentation. VS Code is better to use with repos as you can clone your repos and write your md files straight into the repo, adding collaboration to your documentation. Other tools such as Obsidian are great for writing locally documentation for yourself, (equally you could still use VS Code for this as well).

1. Think about folder structure, structure is important for keeping organised notes
2. all markdown files are suffixed with .md
3. To Preview your docs in VS Code press ++ctrl+shift+v++
