# What is Markdown and why should we use it?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Markdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a website, and produce print-ready documents. If you use GitHub or Gitlab, you'll be familiar with the “readme.md” files that show up in the root of a repository. That “md” stands for markdown. Markdown allows you to effectively communicate with others in your Gitlab issues, pull requests, comments, and documentation. When integrated with Gitlab the collaboration aspect of markdown makes it very powerful and a must for tech teams.

## Why Use Markdown?

You might be wondering why people use Markdown instead of a WYSIWYG editor. Why write with Markdown when you can press buttons in an interface to format your text? As it turns out, there are several reasons why people use Markdown instead of WYSIWYG editors.

* **Markdown can be used for everything.** People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.

* **Markdown is portable.** Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.

* **Markdown is platform independent.** You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.

* **Markdown is future proof.** Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.

* **Markdown is everywhere.** Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.

## Ease of Use and Barrier to Entry

Markdown is the defacto choice for writing software documentation. From open source contributions to private repositories for enterprises, every single README file is written in markdown (i.e. `README.md`).
Markdown gets rid of all the distractions of a formatting toolbar and mouse clicks by helping you focus on your writing without lifting your fingers off of the keyboard.
It does have a small learning curve when using advanced features, however the resources are so abundant you're only a Google search away from achieving anythign you can imagine.
